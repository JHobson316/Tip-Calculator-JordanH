### Progress Report #1 ###
 
I've placed all of the html elements that would be required and made some work on the calculations and logic. The main challenge I'm facing is how to return and display the results after all calculations have been done. Don't have a full plan to fix that yet, but definitely not lightening up on that front. I can't think of any questions I'd have. 

### Progress Report #2 ###

I've finished my css except for a small problem with the background of the tip amount element. The main challenge I'm facing is that I know I have the math correct (what to add to each other and how to get the correct values that I would need to pass on), but the syntax still escapes me. As well, the submit button on my page doesn't return anything, not even an error message.

Finished tip calculator js with returning values and data types and added a README
